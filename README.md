# FindingLaneLines_Project01
### Udacity Self driving engineer nano degree program - Project 01 - Finding Lane Lines

In this project, lane lines on the road have been identified using tools such as color selection, region of interest selection, grayscaling, Gaussian smoothing, Canny Edge Detection and Hought transform line detection.

A pipeline had been developed on a series of individual images, which is then applied to a video stream (really just a series of images).
